# Job Recommendation System (Demo)

This project is a **demo** job recommendation system that showcases how to integrate the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to provide job recommendations based on the user's experience level. The application is built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS.

> **Note**: This is a demo project and does not actually connect to a working MCP server. The functionality is simulated for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **Demo Job Recommendations**: Simulates fetching job recommendations based on the user's input.
- **Experience Levels Supported**: Entry, Mid, and Senior.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI.
- **MCP Integration (Demo)**: Demonstrates how to use the MCP SDK to connect to a server and call tools.

## How It Works (Demo)

1. The user enters their experience level (e.g., `entry`, `mid`, `senior`) in the input field.
2. The application simulates sending the input to an MCP server.
3. A simulated job recommendation is displayed on the page.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Tailwind CSS configured in the project

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-recommendation-system-demo.git
   cd job-recommendation-system-demo
   ```
